                    Flashback Shanghai is an archive of my memories associated with certain places in my hometown Shanghai China. Every week, I create a web design entry based on my recollection at a location in the city that is special to me. It can be a bike ride on a road, a stroll at at a park, a contemplation at a coffee shop, etc. Apart from documenting the dates and the geographic locations, I document my emotions and miscellaneous objects I saw along the way (or any conversations and encounters with people) by using symbols, emojis and illustrations. Photographs from my camera roll are present in many of my entries, as I think they are precious momentos that weave the mood and the imagery into visual collages. In some entries, I come up with a bilingual catchline or a line of poem in English and Chinese that summarizes the piece of memory, adding a poetic sense to the page. At the end of the project, I take all of memory pieces and integrate them into a map of my urban memory. In this post-pandemic era, I wish to create sincere iterations on the concept of urban memory that restores my memoryscape COVID-free.

    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Francine Zhou (she/her)

        Based in New York and Shanghai.
        Currently pursuing Communication Design BFA at Parsons School of Design.
        My practice reflects on the subtle relationships between human memory and urban landscape. 
        Through digital media, painting, photography and calligraphy, my work captures momentary sentiments as individuals interact with nature in a constructed environment. </p>
