    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Francine Zhou (she/her)

        Based in New York and Shanghai.
        Currently pursuing Communication Design BFA at Parsons School of Design.
        My practice reflects on the subtle relationships between human memory and urban landscape. 
        Through digital media, painting, photography and calligraphy, my work captures momentary sentiments as individuals interact with nature in a constructed environment. </p>
