        In UX/ UI design, “States” are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element - there’s the “default”, “active”, “disabled” and of course the “hover state”.
        <br><br>
        The concept of states represents a unique and powerful quality of the web as a medium: the ability to change content and form over time with input from a user. Websites are not static, instead they are ever changing. 
        <br><br>
        Make a website that’s principle focus is on the changing between states. The states you choose can be a binary (day vs. night, messy vs. clean, wet vs. dry, hot vs. cold etc.) or exist more on a spectrum (the spectrum of color, temperature, wealth, sound volume, emotion etc.).

            One way to think about tools is through the lens of inputs and outputs. A tool is a mediator between human input and physical, visual, or conceptual output, and will have a significant impact on what type of output is created. A hammer for instance, takes human energy as input and amplifies force to achieve desired results. Hammers allow us to bang nails into walls 
            <br><br>
            As artists, the tools we use greatly impact the work we create. Drawing in graphite can produce images with a wide range in tonal values while oil paint can help create vibrant paintings with color and texture.
            <br><br>
            Digital tools similarly impact the work we do as graphic designers. Working in illustrator usually produces artwork with a “line-drawing” type of quality, while working with a certain brush in photoshop can add a unique texture. 
            <br><br>
            In this project, you will create your own tool using programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals. Just like the tools mentioned as examples, your tool will take some form of user input as material and transform it into a visual output. We will look at examples together in class.

            Design and develop a website which incorporates an external data feed, using one of the APIs discussed in class. You may also use another API or service that you have researched independently, so long as it provides a live data stream to work with. Consider how your specific design logic might change the meaning of said data, and how the user may (or may not) interact with the feed as they engage with your site.
